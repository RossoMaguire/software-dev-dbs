# Assessment Task

### James has been asked by his partners in “Horizons Motors Ltd” to modernise the company.  


Operating from a garage located in North Dublin City Centre, the company employees 20 staff.  
The company has a good reputation, and does reasonably well, with faithful customers who return to buy or sell, trade-in or service their cars. 
However, due to a paper-based filing system, maintaining customer information and car details can be time-consuming and a lot of duplication occurs across the business. Also, creating reports to gain valuable insights into the performance of the business has often been inaccurate leading to suboptimal decision-making. 

 

James wants to drive the growth of the company. He wants to keep the old faithful customers but attract new ones as well. He is familiar with the services that the Web can perform and is prepared to enlist some help to introduce information systems to help grow the business. 

 

To automate the business and establish a Web presence, he wants to have an information system that lists available new and used cars, commercials and rentals, along with the services available.  All information on the number of seats, doors, engine capacity, power, range, speed, price, tax (on purchase and annual), etc., must be available to prospective customers. Rentals require the terms of the contract such as duration, required deposit, and so on. The system should also collect buyer information such as preferences, the price range that they can afford, and personal information (name, address, etc.). Preferences include size, style, power, and the like. 

 

The system should be able to match buyers’ preferences with new cars available, or sellers’ offerings and, if it cannot find an exact match, should offer the closest matches. The system should be able to assist buyers and sellers alike. Buyers from other locations might need help in choosing a local service agent and, as a result, the system must provide a list of competent mechanics complete with personal information such as name, phone number, and credentials. They might also need help with getting finance, choosing a car, making an offer, getting insurance, and closing the deal. Sellers would need advice on, setting the price, marketing the car, selling the car, and closing the sale. (Sellers may use the advertising service, or sell through the company as a dealer, in which case they must get the car serviced and checked by the company, for an additional commission – you may allow either or both interpretation) 

 

James has recruited you as a team of consultants to make detailed recommendations to develop an information system for the presence of his dealership and garage on the Web. The system must be secure, reliable and fit for purpose. As a team you must state any assumptions you have made and there should be scope for further and future integration. There is a modest budget to encompass capital spend, installation and on-going support and maintenance of a suitable Information System to meet the specific requirements. 

James has a limited budget and he would also like generic recommendations from the team on how best to utilise and integrate Cloud Computing services into the day-to-day operations to improve management, productivity and efficiency.
